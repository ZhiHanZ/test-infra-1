# test-infra
This repository contains tools and configuration files for the testing, benchmarking and automation needs of the datafuse projects.

# Chatbot based build, test, CI infrastructure
Datafuse run benchmark on self-hosted machines, and we suppose that we could run them based on demand, i.e trigger build and benchmarking based on single pull-request comment `/ok-to-fusebench`
